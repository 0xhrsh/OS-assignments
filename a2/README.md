# Assignment 2

## Question D
Note: Make sure you are in directory d before running any of the following command.

### Compilation
- You can directly run ```./run.sh```. This will do all the compilation necessary.

Or you can manually compile:

- Compile ```convert.c``` to ```convert.out``` ```gcc convert.c -o convert.out```
- Compile ```count.c``` to ```count.out``` ```gcc count.c -o count.out```
- Compile ```main.c``` to ```driver``` ```gcc main.c -o driver```

### Running
You can run the code by the following command: ```./driver f1.txt f2.txt```
PS: Here the program driver will take input from file f1.txt and print the output f2.txt. (Feel free to change the file names)

## Question E
Note: Make sure you are in directory e before running any of the following command.
